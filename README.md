#### Project Overview
- **Title**: Takealot Loyalty Program: A Data-Driven Strategy for Customer Retention in a Competitive E-Commerce Landscape
- **Authors**:
  - Workers Mashabela

#### Project Description
This project proposes a data-driven loyalty program for Takealot, South Africa's leading e-commerce platform, to enhance customer retention and increase purchase frequency amid competition from global players like Amazon, Temu, and Shein. Utilizing a synthetic dataset (takealot_customer_dataset.csv), the program leverages predictive and prescriptive analytics, grounded in Social Exchange and Equity Theories, to design a tiered rewards system. The solution aims to recruit high-value customers, improve outcomes for low-value segments, and expand market reach, particularly in underserved regions like the Eastern Cape.

#### Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Includes statistical tests (t-tests, regression) and k-means clustering to segment customers.
- **Model Implementation**: Built in Python using libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, with code designed for reproducibility in Google Colab.
- **Visualizations**: Boxplots, regression scatterplots, PCA cluster plots, and frequency boxplots to support decision-making.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Targeted actions to boost retention, reduce cart abandonment, and enhance satisfaction.
